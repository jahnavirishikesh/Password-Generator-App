# Password-Generator-App

This repository contains a password generator program implemented in Python. The program generates strong and secure passwords based on user-defined criteria and provides the ability to copy the generated password to the clipboard.

- Python 3.7+
- Tkinter library
- pyperclip library

You can install the required libraries using pip, the package installer for Python. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:

```bash
pip install tkinter
pip install pyperclip
```
